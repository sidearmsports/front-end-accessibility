# Front-End Developer Accessibility Tech Test

Thank you for your interest in the Front-End Developer Accessibility position at SIDEARM Sports!

One of the main responsibilities of the Front-End Accessibility Developer is to help SIDEARM bring design to life for EVERYONE! This includes creating a webpage that adheres to our design standards AND our accessibility standards. You can view more about SIDEARMS commitment to accessibility on the [website](https://sidearmsports.com/accessibility/). SIDEARM strives to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards in all of our web applications.

## What We Are Looking For:
For this tech test, we would like you to build a web page containing the specified sections from the Figma design file below. This project will be used to gauge your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, responsive design conventions, as well as meeting our accessibility requirements. You can use whatever frameworks you would like achieve the design, but our review will focus mostly on Accessibility testing, and making sure you page passes scanners such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and manually testing with a screen reader such as [NVAccess](https://www.nvaccess.org/).

- **Accessible:** Follow the guides and check with tooling.  
- **HTML:** semantic HTML, this plays a big part in accessibility.
- **CSS:** feel free to use your favorite pre-processor and boilerplate css (ie. normalize, modernizr, etc.) and CSS frameworks are allowed (bootstrap, foundation, tailwind, etc.).
- **JavaScript:** We use VueJS, but you can use what you like.

## What You Need To Get Started:

- **Figma File:** [https://www.figma.com/file/nsA0rvuI8PxoIgsikJcj57/Candidate-mock](https://www.figma.com/file/nsA0rvuI8PxoIgsikJcj57/Candidate-mock). 
- **Fonts:** Montserrat - [https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Montserrat:wght@400;700;900](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Montserrat:wght@400;700;900) - feel free to add any that were missed.
- **Icons:** [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - they might not be exact to the mockup and that is ok.
- **Images:** see assets directory - or use your own - as long as they are sized the same as the mocks.

Review WCAG 2.1 AA standard, and make sure your page follows the recommendations.

## You Can Make the Following Assumptions:

- While the design is not the focus of the test, we will be checking to see how the site responds to different devices, there should be focus on hitting the mocks as designed.
- We will be checking the site for accessibility with automated scanners and doing a manual scan with a screen reader.
- Code should be written as if you would need to maintain it for years to come.
- **Turnaround Time:** It is understood that you want to put your best foot forward, but we also understand that you have other responsibilities.  Our intention with this tech test is that you should be able to deliver a site you are happy with by spending no more than a couple of hours per night over a couple of nights. 

## What Comes Next: 

If we like what we see, we will bring you back in to go over your code.
